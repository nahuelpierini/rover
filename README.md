Mars Rover Game, it is an adapted version of Mars Rover Cata, where an API was developed that translates commands sent from Earth into instructions that the rover understands. As indicated in Cata, edge wrapping and obstacle detection have been implemented. As well as the movement and turn format of the rover.

This proyect is the final delivery to pass and take a final exam of the BackEnd Java BootCamp at ATL Academy provided by Lucas Moy.
In order for the project to have more value and usefulness, it has been implemented as a simple game whose purpose is:
Through movements and turns, move the rover across the map of Mars towards a final goal, without colliding with various Martian objects that are along the way. Taking into account where the rover is looking, you can make 2 movements: forward and backward; and 2 turns: left or right. You will win if you reach the finish line.
